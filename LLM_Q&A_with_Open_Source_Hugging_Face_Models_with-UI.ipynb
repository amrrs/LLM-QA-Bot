        "He began his acting career portraying Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show (1998–2006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy Coming Soon (1999), followed by the comedy film Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), which was a box office hit.

In 2003, he created and produced the television series Punk'd, also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons.

        "\n",
        "Early life\n",
        "Kutcher was born on February 7, 1978, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Diane (née Finnegan), a Procter & Gamble employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker.[1][2] He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.[3][4]\n",
        "\n",
        "Kutcher was raised in a \"relatively conservative\" Catholic family.[5] He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children.[6] Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.[7] Michael's cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher's home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said he \"didn't want to come home and find more bad news\" about his brother, stating, \"I kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel.\"[8] Kutcher stated that, when he was 13, he contemplated committing suicide to save his brother's life with a heart transplant; when he told his father he was considering jumping from a Cedar Rapids hospital balcony, his father dissuaded him from doing so shortly before doctors announced that a transplant had become available from an accident victim in another state.[9]\n",
        "\n",
        "Kutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek–Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience \"straightened him out\", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.[10]\n",
        "\n",
        "Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to cure his brother's heart ailment.[2] At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too \"noisy\" and \"wild\".[11] Kutcher stated, \"I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.\"[12] To earn tuition money, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and sometimes sold his blood plasma.[13] While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at The Airliner bar in Iowa City, Iowa,[14] and entered the \"Fresh Faces of Iowa\" modeling competition. Placing first, he won a trip to New York City's International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Leaving Iowa for a stay in New York City, Kutcher then returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.[11]\n",

        "Career\n",
        "Modeling\n",
        "After participating in an IMTA competition in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.[15]\n",

        "Kutcher (left) with Two and a Half Men co-star Jon Cryer in September 2011\n",
        "Following his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition.[16] He was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in Pearl Harbor (2001) (replaced by Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), Just Married (2003), and Guess Who (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film Cheaper by the Dozen as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. While the film received negative reviews, it was a box office success.[10]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2003, Kutcher produced and starred as the host in his own series, MTV's Punk'd, that involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg.[17] A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a \"hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once\", including \"the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce\":\n",
        "\n",
        "\"If anything, I'm a trier,\" says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. \"I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.[18]\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of The Guardian, Kutcher was unable to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of That '70s Show, although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale.[10] Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, Killers, in which he played a hitman.[19] In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series Two and a Half Men.[20]\n",

The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it.[22][23] Kutcher earned $750,000 an episode on the show.[24] The show ended with a forty-minute series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\" on February 19, 2015.\n",

Ooma is in the Voice over Internet Protocol business and Kutcher's role was as Creative Director.[36] He spearheaded a marketing campaign and produced viral videos to promote this service.

He stated that on the night that Ellerin was murdered, he (Kutcher) had arrived to pick her up for a date, but that she had not answered the door. His information helped establish the time of death.[57][58] Gargiulo was found guilty and sentenced to death on July 16, 2021, for her murder.[59]\n",

        "In November 2011, Kutcher received heavy criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno \"in poor taste\".[89] Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.[90]\n",
        "\n",
        "On March 8, 2015, Kutcher sparked a national debate regarding the lack of equal access to diaper changing facilities in men's restrooms with this Facebook post: \"There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens [sic] public restrooms. The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page!\"[91]\n",
        "\n",
        "Kutcher has leveraged his social media presence, particularly on Facebook, to post and promote content published by A Plus, a social media-driven content platform and associated company of which he is the chairman.[46]\n",
        "\n",
        "In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign to end child sex trafficking.[92] Kutcher claimed that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. The number was criticized by newspaper The Village Voice. Kutcher and others including the New York Times, C-SPAN, and CNN used a peer-reviewed study referring to minors at risk for sexual exploitation.[93] The Village Voice, from their research, said it was only hundreds of children.[94] Kutcher claimed the criticism by the Village Voice promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that Village Voice advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company.[95][96]\n",
        "\n",
        "Health\n",
        "In August 2022, Kutcher revealed that two years earlier he had been diagnosed with vasculitis, which had impaired his hearing, vision, and mobility during the course of a year.[97][98]\n",
